# C++ Learning MIPT

This repository contains C++ homework solutions and learning materials from MIPT (Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology).

## 📁 Structure

### Homework Assignments
- **HW1_1_solution.cpp** - nullptr_t type conversions and volatile qualifiers
- **HW1_2_solution.cpp** - Valid null pointer dereferencing scenarios  
- **HW1_3_solution.cpp** - Pointer safety and protection mechanisms

### Additional Files
- **my.cpp** - Basic C++ test program for environment setup

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++11 or later compatible compiler (clang++, g++)
- CMake (optional, for complex projects)
- Git

### Compilation
```bash
# Compile individual files
clang++ HW1_1_solution.cpp -o HW1_1_solution
clang++ HW1_2_solution.cpp -o HW1_2_solution
clang++ HW1_3_solution.cpp -o HW1_3_solution

# Run the programs
./HW1_1_solution
./HW1_2_solution
./HW1_3_solution
